I needed a pair of closed-back over ear headphones and these were cheap enough and got good reviews so here they are. They are **fine**. These are the headphones I use when I don't want to be disturbed or disturb others with my music or movies. My only complaint with these is that they feel more like on-ears on my big head and they are not the most comfortable headphone I have ever bought. These Headphones are Priced at about $55.00 usually.

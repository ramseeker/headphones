The [Hifiman Sundara](https://amzn.to/3f0FWJn) is an over the ear headphone that uses planar technology and open back design to give you a fast and detailed sound that only planar headphones can provide. These usually sell for about $350.00 a pair. You might be able to find a [refurbished](https://amzn.to/3f0FWJn) model for a bit cheaper than paying full price.
